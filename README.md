# Koalageddon-Configurator
A extremely simple configuration tool for @acidicoala 's Koalageddon.

Code is rather bloated at this point, I will reformat it...eventually :)

# Features
- Simple TTK GUI with the Breeze theme.
- Will modify the configuration file (Config.jsonc) for each platform, by enabling or disabling injection and replication and by adding or removing id's from the blacklist.
- Simple ID searcher for Steam 
> The max number of results refers to each of the options available for the search, all duplicates are removed before displaying, as such, you may see a lower number of results overall.
- Pictures bloody everywhere ðŸ˜„

# Installation/Usage
- Just download and run the compiled binaries from [here](https://github.com/g-yui/KoalaGeddon-Configurator/releases).
- You can run from source without the need for a specific pyenv, just use pip to install Pillow, Requests, TtkThemes and run main.py.

# Missing features
- Better feedback to the user.
- More checks for IDs.
- More ID searchers.

# Known bugs
- Interface can get buggy if too many IDs are changed at once.
- Rather slugish at times.

# Requirements/Licences
- Pillow, licensed under the open source HPND License.
- TtkThemes, licensed under a GNU GPLv3 compatible License.
- Requests, licensed under the Apache Software License (Apache 2.0).

# Acknowledgments
