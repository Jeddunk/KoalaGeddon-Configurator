# Koalageddon-Configurator
A extremely simple configuration tool for @acidicoala 's Koalageddon.

This code *works* but it's rather basic, I'll work more on it when I have the time, I've uploadded it in case someone wants to fork it and make it better in the meantime.

# Features
- Simple TTK GUI with the Breeze theme.
- Will modify the configuration file (Config.jsonc) for each platform, by enabling or disabling injection and replication and by adding or removing id's from the blacklist.
- Pictures bloody everywhere ðŸ˜„

# Installation/Usage
- Just download and run the compiled binaries from [here](https://github.com/g-yui/KoalaGeddon-Configurator/releases).
- You can run from source without need for a specific pyenv, just use pip to install Pillow and TtkThemes and run main.py.

# Missing features
- Better feedback to the user.
- More checks for IDs.
- An ID searcher.

# Known bugs
- Broken on release version 1.1.0, will patch soon.
- Interface can get buggy if too many IDs are changed at once.
- Rather slugish at times.

# Requirements/Licences
- Pillow, licensed under the open source HPND License.
- TtkThemes, licensed under a GNU GPLv3 compatible License.

# Acknowledgments
- Acidicoala for the creation of such a great tool and the immense help provided for the betterment of this one.
